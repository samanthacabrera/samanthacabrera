# About me

üëã I am a full-stack software engineer based in Denver. I am dedicated to driving positive change and making meaningful contributions to our digital world.

üß∞  I am equipped with a diverse skill set of programming languages and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Python, and Flask.

üöÄ Throughout my immersive experience at FlatIron's Software Engineering Bootcamp, I actively participated in collaborative learning and hands-on projects. These experiences allowed me to gain valuable insights and practical skills in designing user interfaces with React.js and building backend systems using Python and Flask.

‚ù§Ô∏è Web development allows me to express myself creatively while also delivering tangible, practical solutions for clients and users alike. I draw inspiration for my projects from a wide range of sources, including art, and architecture. It is through this fusion of artistry and technology that I find fulfillment and purpose in my work.
